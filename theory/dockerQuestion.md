# Top 50 Docker Interview Questions and Answers

### 1. **What is Docker?**
   **Answer**: Docker is an open-source platform that enables developers to automate the deployment of applications inside lightweight, portable containers. It allows for easy packaging of an application and all of its dependencies into a container.

### 2. **What is a container?**
   **Answer**: A container is a lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient unit in which you can package and run applications. Containers include the application and its dependencies but share the host system's OS kernel.

### 3. **What is the difference between a container and a virtual machine?**
   **Answer**: A virtual machine (VM) virtualizes the hardware, running a separate OS for each instance. In contrast, containers virtualize the OS and share the host OS kernel, making containers more lightweight and faster than VMs.

### 4. **What are Docker images?**
   **Answer**: Docker images are read-only templates used to create containers. They contain the application and all the dependencies required to run it.

### 5. **What is the difference between a Docker image and a container?**
   **Answer**: A Docker image is a static blueprint used to create containers, whereas a container is a running instance of an image. An image is immutable, while a container can be modified during execution.

### 6. **What is Docker Hub?**
   **Answer**: Docker Hub is a cloud-based repository service where you can find, store, and share Docker images. It's Docker's official registry.

### 7. **What is a Dockerfile?**
   **Answer**: A Dockerfile is a text file that contains a set of instructions to build a Docker image. It defines the base image, environment variables, dependencies, and how the application will run.

### 8. **What is Docker Compose?**
   **Answer**: Docker Compose is a tool used to define and manage multi-container Docker applications. It allows you to define services, networks, and volumes using a single YAML configuration file.

### 9. **How do you create a Docker container?**
   **Answer**: You can create a Docker container using the `docker run` command, followed by the image name. For example, `docker run -d -p 80:80 nginx` will create and start a container running Nginx.

### 10. **What is Docker Swarm?**
   **Answer**: Docker Swarm is Docker’s native clustering and orchestration solution for managing a cluster of Docker hosts. It turns a group of Docker engines into a single virtual Docker engine.

### 11. **What is a Docker volume?**
